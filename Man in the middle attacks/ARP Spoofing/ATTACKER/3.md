This step is very important, we building an ARP reqeust and if we receive any reply we save it using subprocess to save on our arp table
i will explain this

```python
from scapy.all import ARP, Ether ,sendp ,conf , get_if_hwaddr, get_if_addr, subprocess , sniff

iface = conf.iface
MyIp = get_if_addr(iface)
MyMac= get_if_hwaddr(iface)
requested = "192.168.0.5"

def packet_handler(pkt):
    if ARP in pkt:
        if pkt[ARP].op == 2:
            #REPLY
            if pkt[ARP].pdst == MyIp and pkt[ARP].psrc == requested:
                subprocess.run(["sudo", "arp", "-s", pkt[ARP].psrc, pkt[ARP].hwsrc ])
                print(f" + ARP REPLY SUCCESS FROM {pkt[ARP].psrc}  and updated in the ARP table of this host with the ip: {MyIp}") 

    arp_packet = Ether(src = MyMac , dst = "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF")/ARP(op=1, pdst = requested , psrc = MyIp, hwsrc = MyMac)
    sendp(arp_packet, iface=iface, count = 1, inter = 1.0) 
    print(f" + ARP REQUEST was sended to {requested} from this host with the ip: {MyIp}")    


sniff(filter="arp", prn = packet_handler, count = 10)
```
ok on this script which you can find on the script folder as *building_arp_request_3.1.py*, we using the propertios of ARP op 1 and 2 to send a request and receive replies if any 

how does it works? well, we filter op=2 to replies and ask "is the reply for our host and is from any predefined ip we want?"
as you can see we defined a variable called "requested" we are going to "catch" the reply coming from 192.168.0.5 because
the process of ARP commands that after a request is receve the host must reply so we at the exact moment we going to receive its reply
now why we using subprocess so embed a command such as "sudo arp -s...."?

we using this becase here happens something very peculiar, when our OS sends an ARP request each x amount of seconds, it sends becaseu it was asked by it
But when we , the user ,send a no requested request (lol), the OS is like 
"hmmm, look bro i see the request going out from the NIC but i aint gonna update the ARP table if any replies comes in..."

believe or not that is how it works, at least on my research with moder 22.04 ubuntu verisons and 2025 kali OS as well

so to bypass this for the completition of this excercise we use subprocess to say the OS we are also in cahrge on ARPs

after that remember the sniff method? is called as always and ntohign change except our little bypass
